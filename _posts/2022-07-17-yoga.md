The past few years I have been leading an asana and pranayama practice in the morning. I would love to expand that with meditation sessions, evening kirtan, satsang and shared healthy meals.

As with the rest of Mars we don’t have paid faculty just enthusiastic practitioners eager to learn from the internet and each other.

On mars we can build a little ashram for ourselves schedule our ideal routine, screen yoga teachers, kirtan performers, and enlightened teachers from around the world. 

If you’d like to be part of the yoga camp at Mars College please indicate in the Application.
