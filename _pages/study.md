    <p>        
        There are no full-time educators at Mars College; we are a federation of people pooling our skills and learning together. Everyone gets to be a teacher and a learner, and contribute to the overall programming in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Study groups make life on Mars lively and help camp run smoothly. People in study groups propose projects, classes or other activities to do together. Members are encouraged to participate in study groups which interest them, and initiate new ones. Study groups may get budget for their activities, and may persist through multiple sessions of Mars College.

        <a href="https://mars.college/work/">Earth, Air, Fire and Water</a> are the core clubs which take care of infrastructure on Mars. Additionally we will begin with a small number of clubs around key interest areas, and then encourage people to form clubs around topics they are interested in:
