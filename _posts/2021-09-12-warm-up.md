As we talked about on the [work](/work) page this year we are organizing our infrastructure along the Earth / Fire / Water / Air lines.. I'd like to flesh this out a bit more.

## Earth
I’m a pallet rack guy. Pallet Racks define the core structure of our camp. Laying them out in sketchup and building them in real life is immensely rewarding for how quickly substantial structure comes into being. This year our main pallet rack structure will form a quad. The four sides visually connected but separated by enough space to enable simultaneous activities in the different sections without too much audio interference between them. We will still have a number of people living in vans and trailers. Additionally this year we will experiment more with tents and pallet rack based living structures. In the warm-up we need to finalize the plan, order the materials, and survey / flag the site. If we have sufficient time and motivation we can consider moving material out to mars and doing some initial building. In the meantime we'll be living on the Venus compound in Bombay Beach and experimenting with some of these systems there.

## Fire
Right now the intention is to set up independent 1kw - 2kw solar systems on the roof of each quad section. This seems like a reasonable scale solar system for people learning about solar for their own #VanLife of off-grid projects. It should be sufficient for running lights, charging devices (including unicycles) and running tv’s or projectors. If we really want to play music we may need to run a generator, but for our regular sunset fire spin & dance party this should be sufficient.

## Water
Maybe the biggest change this year will be in how we handle compost. Last year we called in a porta potty service to pump our black water tanks and clear the waste from two porta potties we rented. It was over $1000 / month expensive, awkward to coordinate, risky if the pump truck got stuck in the sand, and unsatisfying in our pursuit towards general off-grid sustainability.  Our plan this year is to compost human and food waste. We will replace the toilets in our camper trailers with bucket toilets and use hay from local farms for cover material. Leveraging our grey water I hope at the end of Mars College we have a bunch of small trees in grow bags we can use for landscaping. 

## Air
Internet is the final element in our mix. We have fiber coming from ATT to a mobile home in Bombay. Our first priority is to beam that to Mars ro provide strong wifi in all of our live and work spaces. We also need to get a media center TV / projector set up in each of the lounge spaces. If we have time I would like to offer internet to the surrounding community.

## Timeline
If enough people come for the warm-up period November - December I would like to get the Chiba structure set up on Mars and all the systems in place for one section of it. This will give us time to work out the details of how the different systems work and order necessary materials before the main group of people arrive at the beginning of January. 

Ideally within the first 2 weeks of Mars College everyone is settled into their living situation and we have built out our core build with all the systems functioning. Inevitably we’ll continue to tweak our camp to make it pretty or adjust to practical realities but hopefully we can shift our focus towards our other creative endeavors and enjoy the infrastructure we established early on.
