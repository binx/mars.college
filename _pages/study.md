    <p>        
        There are no full-time educators at Mars College; we are a federation of people pooling our skills and learning together. Everyone gets to be a teacher and a learner, and contribute to the overall programming in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Study groups make life on Mars lively. Some lead workshops, performances, exhibitions, and installations. Others build things, grow plants and gardens, and organize events. People in study groups propose projects, classes or other activities to do together.

        Although there are no fixed rules for how study groups spend their time, we encourage them to periodically organize outward facing events for other Martians. Weekly events at a set time work very well. Teach each other what is interesting about a particular subject, whether by performance, exhibition, workshop, or talks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We will be organizing two group exhibitions, one at the halfway point of Mars College, and one at the end, coinciding with the <a href="http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/">Bombay Beach Biennale</a>. Study groups will have the opportunity to prepare something for these shows.

        <a href="https://mars.college/work/">Earth, Air, Fire and Water</a> are the core clubs which take care of infrastructure on Mars. Additionally, we'll begin with a small number of study groups around key interest areas, and then encourage people to form study groups around topics they are interested in. Study groups may receive a budget for their activities, and may persist through multiple sessions of Mars College.
