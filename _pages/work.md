        At its core, Mars College involves people coming together as a physical community in a harsh environment with no amenities provided. This means that we as a community need to take care of all our physical needs, including food, water, shelter, and infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've conceptualized the responsibilities of maintaining Mars College as falling under the four traditional elements: <b>Earth</b>, <b>Air</b>, <b>Water</b>, and <b>Fire</b>. Some of the jobs and chores associated with the elements are listed below.

    <p>
        The most important work we have is that of food preparation. Nothing brings all the Martians together quite like a good meal.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be setting up a well-protected outdoor kitchen and pantry, and organizing regular trips into town to stock up on fresh food and groceries. We are deciding between two options: making a Food Tribe, on par with the other four elements, which exclusively focuses on managing the kitchen and preparing several large group meals a week, or by dividing it up among four other tribes, with each tribe responsible for organizing one meal a week.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <span id="activity">
            ðŸŽ© The sorting hat
        </span>
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        The above jobs capture the burden of constructing and maintaining camp. With our basic needs met, we are <a href="/study">free to pursue our interests</a>. Our primary means of organization revolve around these elements. Everybody at Mars College is expected to consistently contribute to at least one of these domains, in keeping with their skillset and preferences.
    </p>

    <p>
        Martians are encouraged to form tribes around these elements and collaborate on finding innovations which make our lives easier. Some of the work is more front-loaded (initial construction and setup of core infrastructure), whereas others are more regular (water distribution, garden maintenance). Some are more technical, while others are more physical. We hope that Martians take the initiative on the jobs which they feel they can most contribute to, but are free to leave their fate to the <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/6/62/Sorting_Hat.png">sorting hat</a>.
