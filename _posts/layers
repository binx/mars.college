title: A Cyberpunk Hierarchy of Needs
excerpt: <p>Serve the human: Your ultimately responsibility is to care for your personal physical needs.</p>
<p>Serve the physical community: Exert regular physical effort to make life better for everyone in your away-from-keyboard reality.</p>
<p>Serve the virtual community: Engage the global techno-economy. Develop technical skills to make you a valueable member of a remote team 
serving needs electronically. Amass and exercise crypto / capital to lend power to your endeavors.</p>
<p>Serve the all and everything: Go beyond giving and getting. Find union and joy.</p>
