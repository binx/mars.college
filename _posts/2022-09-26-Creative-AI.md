We are all in on creative AI at Mars this year. We're so excited about the rise of large language models like GPT-3 and text-to-image systems like Stable Diffusion. 

Over the last year, a new guild has risen to prominence on the internet, and that is the guild of the prompt engineer -- those sorcerers and sorceresses practicing the art and alchemy of instantly conjuring into pixels detailed images from inside their own imaginations, using techniques for guiding these raw AIs through natural language interface.

Prompt engineering may be mistaken for an artistic fad, but it represents much more. We think prompt engineering is the evolution of software development. Systems like [Replit](https://twitter.com/sergeykarayev/status/1570848080941154304) and [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) hint at this future. Gone will be the days where we must learn arcane things like how to place curly braces, indentations, and semicolons in the right order to get computers to do what we want.

Sounds easy, right? Wrong. As we are discovering, prompt engineering is a deep science unto itself. Budding prompt engineers gather on Twitter, Reddit, and Discord to share with each other tips and tricks for getting these models to do what they want, faster and more accurately, and many of these advancements are indeed counterintuitive. It's early days, but a knowledge basin is forming. For our part, we're making IRL venues to practice this witchcraft together.

### Come major in AI at Mars College and sharpen your prompt engineering skills.

We've been enthusiastic about AI since our first year. The [Abraham project](https://abraham.ai) was incubated here, and we were early makers of GPT-3-powered chatbots on our Discord. Some Martians have been collaborating on a project called [Eden](/2022/07/12/Eden.html), software and infrastructure which hosts and serves models like GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion on-demand, as well as scaffolding to make web applications like [a Collage tool](https://twitter.com/genekogan/status/1555184488606564353). We are also working on Marsbots Studio, a no-code tool for deploying AI-powered bots on Discord and other venues (post forthcoming).

We have our own GPUs, and will make these model pipelines available to all prompt engineers and software developers at Mars who wish to help us build fun new applications on top of them. If you're a developer interested in participating, you're going to love it here. [Join us!](/join)
