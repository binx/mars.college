Camp and Guild

The best strategy for the Prisoner's dilemma trends towards communal benefit only with repeat interactions between players. Without the expectation of future engagement selfishness is the best bet.

Thinking about this in the context of Mars college makes me want to create high level entities which persist over time.  Burningman developed a rich culture with a transient population by focusing on theme camps. Coming back year after year theme camps develop personalities and reputations. The Burningman organization can trust that a long-standing camp understands how to operate and can interact meaningfully even if the leads and members of the camp change from year to year.  One way Burningman supports theme camps is by connecting them with vendors who deliver water, set up generators, or pump blackwater out of the camp trailers. This relationship would be harder to manage if vendors needed to interface with random individuals.

Camps will play a major role in the next Mars College, as well as ‘guilds’ which are a slightly more hippie version of vendor / camp services. Camps and guilds have personality. They have an intent, a style, a perspective. They have material assets, crypto assets and digital assets. They have friends and communication channels. They have needs and desires. They can experience emotions, sickness and health. Camp members care for their camp. Guild’s provide essential services to camps.  Camps are responsible for the welfare of their members and make offerings to the larger community.  With our emphasis on AI I expect camp and guild members to craft chatbots and other artifacts of personality that engage the world. Each camp & guild personality should have a physical presence on Mars. 

Camps apply for placement at Mars College. In the application they describe where camp members will live, where they eat, study, work. They describe what space they need and how it will be laid out. They present an offering to the community. If placed they are allocated a plot which they lease from the MC org. Camps then can sign up and pay for camp services with the different guilds. 

Money will be involved in MC23. Members pay camp fees which collectively cover all the expenses the Camp will encounter over 3 months. Camps pay out to the guilds providing core services water, internet, solar, trash, … to the camps. Guilds use this money to cover their material expenses and pass money onto their members who are actually doing the work.

The formal semester for Mars College camps will run from early January until the end of March. At the beginning of the semester camps have their core infrastructure in place. This typically includes a pallet rack structure with wifi & solar installed, a crib for the camp entity and a utility area with 5 gallon bottles of purified drinking water, a mail area, trash output, and whatever storage bins the camp stored the year before. Camps have the duration of the semester to fully express themselves thru their camps. By April 1 everything needs to be clean and stripped down ready for the guilds to do the final dismantle.

Guild’s begin their work a bit earlier depending on the specific service they provide. Guilds also get allocated a workspace and have a physical seat for the guild personality / mascot. Prior to Mars College beginning in January guilds need to set up their work environment and install whatever necessary gear at each of the camp locations. Similarly, in April guilds need to breakdown and store their workshop as well as whatever specialized gear they have at the camps.

Because of these complexities the Mars College application process will be much longer this year. The core guilds need to get populated with detailed expectations of processes and member commitments defined ahead of time. We can’t finalize any camp placements until each core camp service has a fully staffed credible guild signed up to do all the actual physical work of setup for the different camps, servicing them during MC, and breaking down and storing all the guild stuff at the end. 

Similarly camps need to know what specific living situation each of their members will have. The camp needs a layout they propose for their allotted plot. They need practical solutions in place for how their members will eat and take care of all their necessities. They need to coordinate with their members to put together an initial camp calendar and provide a meaningful offering to the larger Mars College community. In addition to maintaining the welfare of their members and offering something amazing to the larger community camps develop the personalities of their mascots. Cultivating their chatbot personality as well as imbuing them with real functionality like control over the physical environment, or music.

Camp Offerings: Burningman encourages interactivity in theme camp offerings. While that is true for Mars College as well, my hope is that camps may also serve similar roles to departments at traditional universities. Perhaps individual camps will orient around an interest area like drones or electric unicycles, or philosophy or science fiction. It is pretty open and can include art installations, screenings, workshops, parties, feasts and fasts. 

If you’re interested in participating reach out now. The more time we put into planning the next Mars College the more fun and productive the experience will be.
