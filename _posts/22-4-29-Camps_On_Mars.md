The next big shift for Mars College is to smaller, more autonomous camps. This will reduce the administrative burden on the Mars College organizers by reducing the number of people we need to communicate with, shifting more responsibility for participant welfare to the camps, and clarifying what communal effort is expected of camp members. Having smaller camps also enables groups to cluster around shared ideologies and desires around things like communal food, and chores.

Camps apply with an academic or social offering to the larger community, how many residents they can accommodate, how much space they need and how they intend to use that space. 

To support camps we will initiate a number of ‘Camp Services’ to provide core utilities like water, internet, mail and trash to camps. Camp services are small scale worker managed entrepreneurial entities that get paid by camps and pay their workers.

This shift introduces a small circular economy to Mars where campers pay fees to their camps, camps pay for camp services, and camp services pay campers for their effort.
