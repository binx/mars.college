        Mars is a barren landscape with intense sun, frequent cold, and strong winds.
Open for miles around it is a beautiful environment that takes effort to live in.

        
        Mars College takes place on an dry lake bed in the Southern California Desert. We construct a compound of communal structures framed with wood and pallet racks. We figure out water, weather protection, electricity, high-speed internet, and communal working spaces. We strive to live comfortably and get work done while at Mars College. With our basic needs met among a supportive community, we are free to <a href="https://mars.college/study/">pursue our passions</a>.

       Van Conversions, RVs, Camper trailers and other livable spaceships make good domiciles on Mars. The more self contained and self reliant you are the better you can navigate your welfare and happiness. If you’ve been dreaming about vanlife, Mars College is a good chance to build out a van or cargo trailer into a spaceship of your own.

       People flying in, early on their nomad path without a home on wheels, or just really into pallet racks can build out a shelter. Pallet Rack shelters start as platforms with a raised floor, ply roof and walls and mattress. A bare beginning Martians can fill with the soft pleasures of their home world.

       We also have a few trailers, and may be able to connect those not ready for life on another planet with a room in Bombay.

       We really can’t overstate our intense love of electric unicycles. Outside in the desert the distances between places you want to be are perfect for unicycles. They really transform your ability to inhabit an open rural space. We also have some old red beach cruisers. But it’s really all about the unicycles.
