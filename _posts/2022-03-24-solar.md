# The 22 Approach

Many systems, many arrays

* Earth: 2500w PV + 9.6kw Battery
* Water: 2500w PV + 9.6kw Battery
* Air: 1000?w PV + 9.6kw Battery
* Internet: 1000?w PV + ~2kw Battery

# The 22 Results

Initially positive, but unbalancing sunk the ship

* System initially handled okay, though was high in maintenance (many thanks to Flo for leading this!)
* Feb 15: Disaster strikes when a solar charge controller fails, killing an inverter with it. The frankensteined remaining system overdraws every day for two weeks, unbalancing the batteries, beforeâ€¦
* March 2nd: Replacement hardware arrives, but doesnt have enough extra amperage under load to really get the 48v battery array rebalanced
* Trailer batteries struggle to refill themselves, BMS safety open circuits every night from here on out, load is unevenly distributed

# Lessons Learned

* Battery banks need rebalanced, particularly when fully discharging 
* Battery monitors and load monitoring needs to be implemented on all systems from day 1
* Easy and fast ways to bring in generator power to fill up the system need to be built in from day 1
* The cost of losing power to any given building is low, the cost of losing power to refrigerators is high, the cost of losing power to internet is unbearable
* Our battery banks were too small: the 4x200ah48v only gave us 9.6kwh, enough to run the 1kw load for only 9 hours - not enough margin for error (also hard on the batteries)
* Lost significant PV generation capacity to systems that did not use the power

# What about 2023?

Proposal: the **Power Room**

3 systems based on criticality, colocated in partially dust protected space:
* **Primary**: Largest system, handles main load, chargers, trailers
* **Secondary**: frigerators, hydroponics, also able to step in for short stints in the event of primary failures 
* **Critical**: Very small system for internet only 

Solar panels remain on roofs for solarpunk #a e s t h e t i c but send power down to power room @ 120v so minimal voltage drop 

Additional details / changes

* Built in AC power selector for effortless changes between generator and inverter supply - $40 per, and allows non technical users to begin recovery 
* 4x small (cheap) 12v chargers to rebalance the 48v battery banks
* A large dedicated 48v battery charger to allow a generator to charge the 48v system (this is somewhat expensive and is medium priority, would be very nice and vastly improve recovery post full discharge)
* Using 24v for the two smaller systems would reduce the amount of rebalancing, using 48v for the main system reduces voltage loss to wire inefficiency - there is a case to be made for for going all 24v or all 48v though
* Allocating an extra 24v inverter + 2 batteries for a float would be optional, removes generator noise (major art car style points)
