title: Study groups at Mars College
description: Academic life on Mars revolves around a collection of study groups, ranging from those learning about technology (e.g. AI, VR/XR, telepresence), to those focused on life skills (e.g. culinary arts, vanlife, fitness, work-remote), to those dedicated to art and creativity (e.g. music, dance, crafts).

        Academic life on Mars revolves around a collection of study groups. Study groups research subjects of interest to us, organize activities, and perform valuable camp services in exchange for space and resources. They come in many forms, ranging from those learning about technology (e.g. AI, VR/XR, telepresence), to those focused on life skills (e.g. culinary arts, vanlife, fitness, work-remote), to those dedicated to art and creativity (e.g. music, dance, crafts).

        There are no full-time educators at Mars College; we are a federation of people trying to pool our skills and learn together. As such, study groups are mostly self-directed, and are encouraged to leverage online courses, blogs, open-source materials, and other free online resources to educate themselves and the community about their findings.
