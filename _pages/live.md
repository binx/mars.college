        At its core, Mars College involves people coming together as a physical community in a harsh environment with no amenities provided. This means that we as a community need to take care of all our physical needs, including food, water, shelter, electricity, internet and waste. Everybody at Mars College is expected to consistently contribute to at least one of these domains.
    </
    <p>
        We've conceptualized the responsibilities of maintaining Mars College as falling under the four traditional elements: <b>Earth</b>, <b>Air</b>, <b>Water</b>, and <b>Fire</b>. Some of the jobs and chores associated with the elements are listed below.

        Nothing brings Martians together quite like a good meal.

    <p>
        We will be setting up a well-protected outdoor kitchen and pantry, and organizing regular trips into town to stock up on fresh food and groceries. We are deciding between two options: making a Food Tribe, on par with the other four elements, which exclusively focuses on managing the kitchen and preparing several large group meals a week, or by dividing it up among four other tribes, with each tribe responsible for organizing one meal a week.
