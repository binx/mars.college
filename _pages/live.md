        Mars College takes place on an ancient dry lake bed in the Sonoran Desert. We adhere to the radical self reliance and leave no trace principles from Burningman.  
We construct an inner compound of communal structures framed with wood and pallet racks to provide closed in work spaces, kitchen areas, wind protection and shade for the tent living areas.

Tents: The default personal living space, Mars participants are provided a 3 person tent with a mattress. These are densely arranged in the Mars inner compound where they can take advantage of the shade and wind protection of the main community structure.  People with sturdier tents of their own may set them up outside the compound where they may enjoy the expansive views and a bit more personal space, but will need to handle the intense sun and winds of the desert. Heavy duty Bell tents have withstood the winds in past years.

Cars, Vans & Trailers: We are proponents of the #VanLife lifestyle. People who wish to live in their vehicles park just outside the compound walls. This creates an additional neighborhood with some protection from the communal structures and easy access to the community amenities. If youâ€™ve been dreaming about #VanLife Mars College is a good chance to build out a van or cargo trailer into the mobile tiny home youâ€™ve been thinking about. 

DIY: Over time people may be inspired to build out a more rigid structure for their personal camping space. DIY shelters can take advantage of the pallet rack communal structure for support. Keep in mind the Leave No Trace principle and build structures with standard components that can be reused in the future.






At its core, Mars College involves people coming together as a physical community in a harsh environment with no amenities provided. This means that we as a community need to take care of all our physical needs, including food, water, shelter, electricity, internet and waste. Everybody at Mars College is expected to consistently contribute to at least one of these domains.

        We've conceptualized the responsibilities of maintaining Mars College as falling under the four traditional elements: <b>Earth</b>, <b>Air</b>, <b>Water</b>, and <b>Fire</b>. Some of the jobs and chores associated with the elements are listed below.

        Nothing brings Martians together quite like a good meal.

        We will be setting up a well-protected outdoor kitchen and pantry, and organizing regular trips into town to stock up on fresh food and groceries. We are deciding between two options: making a Food Tribe, on par with the other four elements, which exclusively focuses on managing the kitchen and preparing several large group meals a week, or by dividing it up among four other tribes, with each tribe responsible for organizing one meal a week.
