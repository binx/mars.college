vanlife program

        At its core, Mars College involves people coming together as a physical community in a harsh environment with few or no amenities provided. This means that we as a community need to take care of all our physical needs, including food, water, shelter, and infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've conceptualized the responsibilities of maintaining Mars College as falling under the four traditional elements: <b>Earth</b>, <b>Air</b>, <b>Water</b>, and <b>Fire</b>. Some of the jobs and chores associated with the elements are listed below.

Are you a developer working with smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, or aspiring to become one? Do you also have an interest in low-cost, sustainable, nature and community-oriented life? Then we are interested in having you join us for Mars College. Please read on...

What is Mars College?

Mars College is a residential community in the Sonoran Desert of Southern California, dedicated to helping people learn how to adopt a low-cost, sustainable, self-reliant lifestyle, in a natural setting alongside a community of like-minded people. We are equal parts incubator, educational program, and intentional community, with a diverse mix of interests spanning from yoga to vanlife to AI.

Since Jan 2020, we've organized two quarters, during which a cohort of 30-50 people came together to build a temporary off-grid village in a remote desert location we call Mars. Instead of charging people money, we expect everyone to help build and sustain our community, as well as contribute to our collective interests and intellectual pursuits. To learn more about what we do, see the "live", "work", and "study" pages, or see our photo gallery.

We are currently preparing an open call for the 2022 program, which will occur in the first quarter of 2022, with a warm-up period in November and December. In addition to Mars College, we are in the early stages of establishing a rural wireless internet service provider in our local area, rehabilitating a decrepit but glorious old bank in a nearby town we intend to convert into a makerspace, and setting up an RV/van dealership. Although our scope is large, we are still very small, and will need people to help us make these programs thrive.


What is Mars College not?

We are not a pay-to-play resort offering digital nomads lush jungle cottages, ___, and ayuahuasca ceremonies. This is the desert. It's hot, dry, and barren -- basically what much of the rest of California might look like in 20-50 years. The pictures might look nice, but there's a lot of work behind the scenes, and the environment can be harsh. We are looking for people who will stay with us for a while, grow into a role, and help us fix the many broken things around us. 

Why smart contracts and cryptocurrencies?

Decentralization is a core principle of our project. Rather than forming a hierarchy or monolithic enterprise, we want to develop a blueprint for how individuals and small communities can replicate and innovate on our model. We are fascinated by cryptocurrencies, tokens, and decentralized governance protocols, and have a long-term ambition to embrace these technologies and form a constellation of autonomous communities that are economically and culturally linked.


Is this a job? What will I get out of it?

In short, no. We do not yet have a specific crypto project we are building, and don't have work to give you. For now, we just want to to begin learning how to program smart contracts, issue tokens, experiment with governance tools, and begin building from the bottom up tools which may help us tokenize aspects of our project. We'd like for you to teach us, and in return we offer a supportive social infrastructure for testing out experimental ideas with tokens.

We have no prior experience, and you would play a leading role in helping this initiative get off the ground, which could certainly lead to a longer-term commitment if the stars align. 

In return, we offer a place in our community, a social infrastructure to apply your skills to. Our community is what

    <p>
        The most important work we have is that of food preparation. Nothing brings all the Martians together quite like a good meal.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be setting up a well-protected outdoor kitchen and pantry, and organizing regular trips into town to stock up on fresh food and groceries. We are deciding between two options: making a Food Tribe, on par with the other four elements, which exclusively focuses on managing the kitchen and preparing several large group meals a week, or by dividing it up among four other tribes, with each tribe responsible for organizing one meal a week.

            ðŸŽ© The sorting hat

    </h2>
    
    <p>
        The above jobs capture the burden of constructing and maintaining camp. With our basic needs met, we are <a href="/study">free to pursue our interests</a>. Our primary means of organization revolve around these elements. Everybody at Mars College is expected to consistently contribute to at least one of these domains, in keeping with their skillset and preferences.
    </p>

    <p>
        Martians are encouraged to form tribes around these elements and collaborate on finding innovations which make our lives easier. Some of the work is more front-loaded (initial construction and setup of core infrastructure), whereas others are more regular (water distribution, garden maintenance). Some are more technical, while others are more physical. We hope that Martians take the initiative on the jobs which they feel they can most contribute to, but are free to leave their fate to the <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/6/62/Sorting_Hat.png">sorting hat</a>.
