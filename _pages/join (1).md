    Mars College is a 3-month program, during which we build up a <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/chiba/">temporary village</a> on a 20-acre stretch of open desert in Southern California called <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/desert/">Mars</a>, where we <a href="/live">live</a>, <a href="/work">work</a>, and <a href="/study">study</a> together.
</p>
<p>
    The next Mars College will take place Q1 2023. The exact calendar is as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Warm-up period</b>: Dec 2022</li>
        <li><b>Quarter Begins</b>: 2 Jan 2023 </li>
        <li><b>Build + Ideas Week</b>: 2 Jan - 7 Jan 2023 </li>
        <li><b>Mid Term</b>: 17 Feb 2023 </li>
        <li><b>Final Showcase</b>: 31 March - 2 April 2023 </li>
        <li><b>Wind-down period</b>: Apr 2023 </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The end of the quarter culminates in a final showcase and art installation called <a href="#the_simulation">The Simulation</a>, after which we dismantle the village, leaving no trace, to disband and await the next season.
</p>
<p>
    We are looking for exceptional people with passions for art, technology, and other creative pursuits to join us. There are two categories of participants on Mars: those in the <a href="#mars_residency">Mars residency</a> and those in <a href="#mars_college">Mars college</a>. Each one is described in the following sections.
</p>
<p>
    This upcoming quarter is our third session overall, following <a href="/gallery/2021/">2021</a> and <a href="/gallery/2022">2022</a>. Mars College grew out out of a precursor in 2020 called <a href="https://brahman.ai/">BRAHMAN</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    <span id="mars_residency">
        Mars residency
    </span>
</h2>

<p>This is the most open-ended and least strings-attached way to be a part of our community, and how to participate with relatively few requirements.</p>

<p>Residents can be as much a part of the full Mars College program as they wish or can afford to be. They have an open invitation to all the activities we put on, and are encouraged to offer workshops or seminars in areas that interest them, but are not required to contribute much, other than basic upkeep of any facilities they use. T</p>

<p>Residents are expected to be self-reliant and arrange their own shelter, either by bringing a van or RV with them, or renting a room in Bombay Beach (we may be able to help with this).</p>

<p>The residency is optimal for self-directed and highly independent people, those with full-time jobs, those who are curious about visiting but not committed to stay for long, or those who are simply interested in joining our community but desire having comparatively fewer responsibilities or expectations of them.</p>

</h2>

<p>Mars College is a structured and intentional 3-month program which is part educational and part incubator for specific art & tech initiatives and creative exploration.</p>

<p>Participants in Mars College are expected to sign up for a major field of study (details next section), regularly attend and contribute to the activities, and develop or contribute to a final project. The first half of the quarter will revolve around open-ended exploration of their fields, culminating with a midterm presentation outlining a project they wish to carry out. During the second half, they will develop projects together to present at the final showcase at the end of the quarter. While you need to declare a major, you are free to participate in all the other study groups or to propose your own.</p>

<p>Mars College is best for those with more free time, and seeking a deeper or more immersive experience while here. Participants who can take an active role in Mars College will receive priority for housing and other resources we have.</p>

<h2>Projects and fields of study</h2>

<p>For 2023, we are organizing the following study groups at Mars College. All Mars College participants and Mars residents alike can participate in any or all of these study groups, or propose new ones, but Mars College participants are requried to declare at least one of them as a major, and contribute a final project to it.</p>

<p>Although these groups represent areas we wish to consolidate efforts into, Martians are encouraged to think outside the box and bring other disciplines into the study program.</p>

<ul>
    <li><u>Creative AI</u>: Building AI agents who generate images, sound, and text, on top of <a href="/2022/07/12/Eden.html">Eden</a>. This will include ongoing experimentation with our <a href="https://github.com/mars-college/marsbots">Discord bots</a>, and exploration of tools for AI-assisted creativity.</li>
    <li><u>Yoga</u>: Regular <a href="/2022/07/17/yoga.html">yoga</a>, meditation, and breathing exercises.</li>
    <li><u>DAOs and crypto</u>: A study group devoted to researching and applying decentralization technology to the Martian enterprise.</li>
    <li><u>Art and craft</u>: Fine arts on Mars and in Bombay Beach, including <a href="/gallery/paint/">street art</a>, <a href="/gallery/installation/">sculpture</a>, and <a href="/gallery/ceramic/">ceramics</a> in coordination with our friends at <a href="https://bbartsculture.org/">BBAC</a>.</li>
    <li><u>3d design and metaverse</u>: Using 3d design software to create a virtual counterpart of Mars in the metaverse.</li>
    <!-- <li><u>Electric Unicycle Club</u>: A <a href="/euc/">squad practicing the electric unicycle</a> and going on excursions together. -->
</ul>

    <span id="the_simulation">
        The Simulation
    </span>
</h2>

<p>The Simulation is a large art installation we are planning to build on Mars, which will represent the culmination of the efforts of the study groups. Each study group will contribute something to the Simulation. The Simulation is the guiding light for all the study groups, uniting them with a shared goal, as well as our offering to the <a href="http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/">Bombay Beach Biennale</a>..</p>

<p>While the precise nature of The Simulation cannot be predicted ahead of time, we think it may include some of the following byproducts of the study groups:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A massive physical installation, framed by pallet racks, and adorned by light, paint, sound, sculpture, and the other fruits of our collective labor.</li>
    <li>An immersive virtual world counterpart representing the digital avatar of Mars, the dual of the physical installation.</li>
    <li>Bots and AI entities who dynamically produce live content and interactions inside the Simulation.</li>
    <li>Live audiovisual performances simultaneously inside the virtual and physical worlds.</li>
</ul>



<!-- 

Build Week + lightning talks in the evenings
ideas week
Survey - one month of regular meetings to explore the state of the art in a particular area, make simple demos, and formulate a final project idea.
Mid Term - People discuss a bit what they've learned and present their idea for their final project   
Project - month where people put together their final project.
Final Show  -->


<!-- Advisors Duties:
Describe Their field of interest, what they will explore during the survey, the types of projects they'd like to see for the final.
Interview people they want to work with during the selection process setting expectations.
Organize the survey meetups. Ideally at least once a week could be more. I was thinking of doing 3-4 times a week and just inviting people to share what they've created or found from the web that was compelling. Maybe simple homework. Really up to the advisor.
Help people define their project
Wrangle people to present for the mid-term.
No strict duties after the midterm.

Possible Advisors:
Freeman
Gene
Vanessa
Anderson
?
Raph  - maybe he'd be into advising a crypto group
Nico 
Jmill

Pseudo 
Marzipan 

I'm open to Street Art / Ceramics / Bio / Math / Yoga  if the advisors want to specifically invite people for these topics and follow this structure.  


Work Study
I'm not sure if people coming specifically to work with you on Eden exactly fits this format. Seems like we could also have 'house projects' that we are looking for help with. Maybe to begin with this is just Eden, but could also include 'telepresence', unicycles, building trailers, etc.   For this we'd just make a page describing the project and who we're looking for to participate. Doesn't need to conform to any other structure.


Vision Doc
It would be great if we could pull together a vision doc which describes how we see the metaverse, ai, and crypto tying together in the simulation. Maybe this gows to include the Niland prosperity sphere / Neocity. This feels like something maybe we could pick away at in the blog. Describing bits of it as we have time and clarity that eventually coalesces into a big unified thing.

    <p>
        An open call for the next session will come out in September 2021. Additionally, we are looking for a small number of people to join us early for an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we prepare for the main quarter. Lastly, we have some long-term initiatives for which we are also seeking people to come help us on a more semi-permanent basis, some of which may present opportunities for paid work.

        In the beginning of the quarter, we'll build an <a href="/gallery/off-grid">off-grid</a> village on Mars that we call <a href="/gallery/chiba">Chiba</a>, using low-cost and reusable <a href="/gallery/pallet_racks">building components</a>. We'll setup an electrical grid from <a href="/gallery/solar">solar power</a>, connect to our high-speed internet network in town, and begin a rotation for managing food, water, waste, and composting/gardening. <a href="/work">More info about the work that goes into Mars College</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Chiba is built, we spend our time organizing educational and creative activities on Mars and in Bombay Beach, including workshops, study groups, and some invited talks. We also have some meals together, film screenings, <a href="/gallery/yoga">yoga</a>, group bike and <a href="/euc">electric unicycle</a> rides, and other fun stuff. We also setup some communal areas for co-working. <a href="/study">More info about our activities</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main quarter culminates in two exhibitions that we organize together, one at the half-way point in mid-February, and a final show at the end of March, coinciding with the <a href="http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/">Bombay Beach Biennale</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the 2022 quarter begins, we will have an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we are looking for a small number of people to come early and help us prepare for the 2022 quarter. During this time, we are smaller, more informal, and mostly focused on infrastructure projects and preparing the build on Mars.
