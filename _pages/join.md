We have scheduled January 2021 to bring an initial batch of students to start an academic quarter, subject to limitations <a href="/join/#covid">due to COVID-19</a>. We are also open to a small number people to join us early this fall to help us prepare for the first quarter and begin building out Mars.

        Mars College is anchored to a 3-month program, during which a cohort of 30-50 people build up a <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/chiba/">temporary village</a> on a 20-acre stretch of open desert in Southern California we call <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/desert/">Mars</a>. During the quarter, we live, <a href="/work">work</a>, and <a href="/study">study</a> together on Mars. At the end, we dismantle the village, leaving no trace, to await the next season.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next Mars College session will take place Q1 2022. It is our second session overall, following the inaugural one in 2021. Mars College grew out out of a precursor in 2020 called <a href="https://brahman.ai/">BRAHMAN</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An open call for the next session will come out in September 2021. Additionally, we are looking for a small number of people to join us early for an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we prepare for the main quarter. Lastly, we have some long-term initiatives for which we are also seeking people to come help us on a more semi-permanent basis, some of which may present opportunities for paid work.
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Warm-up period</b>: Nov-Dec 2021</li>
            <li><b>Main quarter</b>: 1 Jan 2022 -> 31 Mar 2022 </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Mars College is a free program, with some basic amenities provided. There is no fee to live here or participate. Instead, we ask Martians to commit to the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul class="join_catch">
            <li><b>To be present</b> for the full three months of the quarter, with no more than two weeks of absence. Some exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis for those who can only stay part of the time (which can be indicated in the application). We just want to prioritize people who will stay and build with us, rather than serve as an intermittent stop for digital nomads. Everyone who fulfills this requirement will receive a <a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP certificate</a>.</li>
            <li><b>To help</b> us with the workload that goes into building up, maintaining, and tearing down our village on Mars. In practice, this amounts to little more than a couple hours a week for most people, but we'll have to band together to do the gruntwork that makes life on the desert tolerable. <a href="/work">More info on work</a>.</li>
            <li><b>To be active</b> participants in our study groups. This is largely self-directed, and you contribute by helping us activate the intellectual and artistic life on Mars. We teach each other about that which inspires us. <a href="/study">More info on study groups</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the beginning of the quarter, we'll build an <a href="/gallery/off-grid">off-grid</a> village on Mars that we call <a href="/gallery/chiba">Chiba</a>, using low-cost and reusable <a href="/gallery/pallet_racks">building components</a>. We'll setup an electrical grid from <a href="/gallery/solar">solar power</a>, connect to our high-speed internet network in town, and begin a rotation for managing food, water, waste, and composting/gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Chiba is built, we spend our time organizing educational and creative activities on Mars and in Bombay Beach, including workshops, study groups, and some invited talks. We also have some meals together, film screenings, <a href="/gallery/yoga">yoga</a>, group bike and <a href="/euc">electric unicycle</a> rides, and other fun stuff. We also setup some communal areas for co-working. <a href="/study">More info about our activities</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main quarter culminates in two exhibitions that we organize together, one at the half-way point in mid-February, and a final show at the end of March, coinciding with the <a href="http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/">Bombay Beach Biennale</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the 2022 quarter begins, we will have an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we are looking for a small number of people to come early and help us prepare for the 2022 quarter. During this time, we are smaller, more informal, and mostly focused on infrastructure projects and preparing the build on Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
        After we take everything down from Mars, the wind-down period in April starts. We continue some activities in town, as people slowly trickle out. At the end, Mars will have no trace of us and we will disband for the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have some long-term initiatives for which we are also seeking people to come help us on a more semi-permanent basis. More information about <a href="#longterm">warm-up and long-term initiatives</a>.

    <p>
        Mars College primarily takes place on <a href="/gallery/desert">Mars</a>, our off-grid campus in the Sonoran desert roughly 1 mile away from Bombay Beach, as well as several locations in town.
    </p>
    <p>
        For shelter, Martians have a few options. The most basic is a tent in a communal area on Mars, which is free. We provide water, weather protection, electricity, and internet. We also have some materials and tools for fabricating <a href="/gallery/hexayurt">hexayurts</a> or other kinds of more robust shelter. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are fans of the <a href="/gallery/vanlife">vanlife</a> and <a href="/gallery/containers">tiny house</a> movements, and encourage people to bring vans or RVs if they have them, and can possibly facilitate buying or leasing new or refurbished vans for Martians interested in picking up the vanlife. We also have access to a limited number of housing rentals in town (Bombay Beach), around a mile from Mars.
    </p> 
    <p>
        We plan to practice social distancing and rapid testing on-entry, to establish a COVID-free Mars, and retain some spaces to quarantine anybody who suspects illness. We will scale this strategy up or down in accordance to the current severity of the pandemic and consensus of the current residents. We enjoy an extremely large degree of social isolation and outdoor activity, which helps us avoid outbreaks, but given the nature of our program, we are not able to guarantee a perfect bubble for the whole quarter. For that reason, we ask Martians to be considerate of each other and up-front about their risk levels, and we most of all require Martians to avoid putting locals at risk.

    </h2>
    <p>
        In addition to the main quarter, we have a number of ongoing projects, all in their infancy, which we are looking for people to get involved with on a more long-term basis, beginning paths that can lead to leadership roles in our community. These projects are funded, and some of the work associated with them will be paid or present opportunities to get equity in whatever enterprises come out of them.

    <ul class="initiatives">
        <li>
            <b>Wireless internet service provider</b>: we have recently installed high-speed, fiber-based internet connected to a property in nearby Bombay Beach. We are the only ones with fiber internet that we know of in our local area, which mostly consists of rural households connected via satellite, or not at all. We are slowly learning how to form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Internet_service_provider">WISP</a>, in order to provide internet to others in our geographical region, eventually possibly scaling out to Slab City. The WISP requires both technical work, including configuring the network and administering to customers, as well as physical, non-technical work, including on-site equipment and relay installations. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Neocity</b>: we are rehabilitating a 100-year old <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=niland+bank&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjZsoGR6vzxAhUFZ98KHexEDqQQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=niland+bank&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECCMQJzoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOgIIADoHCCMQ6gIQJzoECAAQQzoHCAAQsQMQQzoGCAAQBRAeOgYIABAIEB46BAgAEBhQ-RhYsCZg4ydoAXAAeACAAXWIAZkGkgEEMTEuMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nsAEKwAEB">former bank in Niland</a> which has been mostly abandoned for the last 40 years. We have already done a great deal of work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQwrFlODDNn/">fixing a collapsed roof</a> and clearing out most of the trash. We dream of converting the building, which we call Neocity, into a lively makerspace and service center facilitating the same ideals we strive for at Mars College. We plan to outfit it with solar panels, create a garden, and fill all of the bays with perennial activity. It's a long project, and is just getting off the ground. Thos who get involved with us at this stage in the project will be able to assume a leadership position very quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Telepresence robot</b>: We have developed <a href="https://github.com/mars-college/mars-rover">our own software</a> for live-streaming 360 video to a remote observer in a VR headset or smartphone. We are interested in building an immersive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence">telepresence robot</a>, and deploying it across drones, electric vehicles, and other form factors. We want to partner with people who have experience with and/or interest in robotics and electronics. We're interested in evolving this project into an open-source commercial enterprise, as well as integrating it into the main program at Mars College. As such, anybody who partners with us would have the opportunity of obtaining equity in any enterprise that comes from it, as well as material and financial support on the R&D.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Decentralization technology</b>: We are interested in incorporating more elements of blockchain technology into our activities at Mars College, as well as into the Mars College organization itself. Decentralization is a foundational principle for us, and we'd like to experiment with tokens, DAOs, and other crypto-based governance mechanisms. <a href="/2021/07/21/crypto.html">We are actively looking for people to help us kickstart this effort</a>.
