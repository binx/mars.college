        Mars College is anchored to a 3-month program, during which a cohort of 30-50 people build up a <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/chiba/">temporary village</a> on a 20-acre stretch of open desert in Southern California we call <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/desert/">Mars</a>. During the quarter, we <a href="/live">live</a>, <a href="/work">work</a>, and <a href="/study">study</a> together on Mars. At the end, we dismantle the village, leaving no trace, to await the next season.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next Mars College session will take place Q1 2022. It is our second session overall, following the inaugural one in 2021. Mars College grew out out of a precursor in 2020 called <a href="https://brahman.ai/">BRAHMAN</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An open call for the next session will come out in September 2021. Additionally, we are looking for a small number of people to join us early for an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we prepare for the main quarter. Lastly, we have some long-term initiatives for which we are also seeking people to come help us on a more semi-permanent basis, some of which may present opportunities for paid work.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Warm-up period</b>: Nov-Dec 2021</li>
            <li><b>Main quarter</b>: 1 Jan 2022 -> 31 Mar 2022 </li>
            <li><b>Wind-down period</b>: Apr 2022 </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the beginning of the quarter, we'll build an <a href="/gallery/off-grid">off-grid</a> village on Mars that we call <a href="/gallery/chiba">Chiba</a>, using low-cost and reusable <a href="/gallery/pallet_racks">building components</a>. We'll setup an electrical grid from <a href="/gallery/solar">solar power</a>, connect to our high-speed internet network in town, and begin a rotation for managing food, water, waste, and composting/gardening. <a href="/work">More info about the work that goes into Mars College</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Chiba is built, we spend our time organizing educational and creative activities on Mars and in Bombay Beach, including workshops, study groups, and some invited talks. We also have some meals together, film screenings, <a href="/gallery/yoga">yoga</a>, group bike and <a href="/euc">electric unicycle</a> rides, and other fun stuff. We also setup some communal areas for co-working. <a href="/study">More info about our activities</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main quarter culminates in two exhibitions that we organize together, one at the half-way point in mid-February, and a final show at the end of March, coinciding with the <a href="http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/">Bombay Beach Biennale</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the 2022 quarter begins, we will have an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we are looking for a small number of people to come early and help us prepare for the 2022 quarter. During this time, we are smaller, more informal, and mostly focused on infrastructure projects and preparing the build on Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
        After we take everything down from Mars, the wind-down period in April starts. We continue some activities in town, as people slowly trickle out. At the end, Mars will have no trace of us and we will disband for the summer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mars College primarily takes place on <a href="/gallery/desert">Mars</a>, our off-grid campus in the Sonoran desert roughly 1 mile away from Bombay Beach, as well as several locations in town. For housing options, please see the <a href="/live">Live</a> page. 
    </p> 
    <p>        
        We are monitoring the pandemic closely, and plan to practice basic guidelines to establish a COVID-free Mars. We have rapid testing kits on-site, and retain some spaces to quarantine anybody who suspects illness. We will scale this strategy up or down in accordance to the current severity of the pandemic and consensus of the current residents. We enjoy an extremely large degree of isolation and outdoor activity, which helps us avoid outbreaks, but we ask Martians to be considerate of each other and up-front about their risk levels, and we most of all require Martians to avoid putting locals at risk.
    </p>
   <h2>
        <span id="calendar">
            What we ask for
        </span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mars College is a free program, with some basic amenities provided. There is no fee to live here or participate. Instead, we ask Martians to commit to the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul class="join_catch">
            <li><b>To be present</b> for the full three months of the quarter, with no more than two weeks of absence. Some exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis for those who can only stay part of the time (which can be indicated in the application). We just want to prioritize people who will stay and build with us, rather than serve as an intermittent stop for digital nomads. Everyone who fulfills this requirement will receive a <a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP certificate</a>.</li>
            <li><b>To help</b> us with the workload that goes into building up, maintaining, and tearing down our village on Mars. In practice, this amounts to little more than a couple hours a week for most people, but we'll have to band together to do the gruntwork that makes life on the desert tolerable. <a href="/work">More info on work</a>.</li>
            <li><b>To be active</b> participants in our study groups. This is largely self-directed, and you contribute by helping us activate the intellectual and artistic life on Mars. We teach each other about that which inspires us. <a href="/study">More info on study groups</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
        <span id="jobs">
            Can I come to Mars College while maintaining a full/part-time job?
        </span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Yes you can. We are supporters of the work-from-home life, and we have high-speed internet and communal work spaces to support you. As long as you can still contribute to the program and be present, you should be able to keep all your obligations and still be part of Mars College. The only catch is that we prioritize the space/housing that we have access to for people who are the most present. If you have a full-time job while at Mars College, we may ask you to bring your own accommodations (like a van or RV) or arrange a rental in Bombay Beach.
