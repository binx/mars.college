experimenting with having one side open into the desert... nervous about letting the wind in tho... Filling in detail in other areas.. first shot at putting in a water tank and kitchen sinks, shower stalls and composting toilets. Also exploring having a housing block that people could develop on their own.

The center square feels a bit too big. Explore bringing the four houses closer together and making an outer wall to block the wind for tent communities.

Rather than wings, maybe have single story rooms coming off the sides of the main structures. These could be private rooms, or more conference / screening / lounge space

Initial shot at the '22 main structure. Basic idea is to use the same pallet racks that we had for Chiba last year, but break it into 4 more independent sections. 
This reflects this years theme of Earth, Fire, Water, Air and makes the four sections a bit more independent. My feeling last year was that the center alley had a
great communal vibe, but that with the structure so open any activity happening anywhere in the structure carried over to other areas making it difficult to have
multiple simultaneous activities. Other areas I would like to imporove on over last year are:
- as nice as it was being open, eventually the winds picked up and we didn't have sufficient weather protection on the ground floor. This year the ground floor needs to be completely walled in.
- other than Kate's stripper pole and occasional yoga we didn't really utilize the middle floor. This year I'd like to spread more tables and power strips around the middle level making these spaces the default cyber work areas. 
- showers
- composting toilets
- wind blocks and shade for tents
- DIY shelters

[Disorient's Burningman Urban Plan](https://wiki.disorient.info/index.php?title=Urban_plan) is a model all desert camps can look to for guidance on how to 
organize a big camp. It provides practical guidance to people building and an artifact we can look back on to see details of camp installations over the years. 
We don’t have [The Eye](https://flyvision.org/the_eye/03/)’s sketchup skills or experience, but the Disorient Urban Plan gives us a good model to look to as we 
conceive Mars '22.
