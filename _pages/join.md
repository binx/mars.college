    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    Mars College is in its infancy, and we are still working on a more concrete calendar and structure to the program. With the pandemic making it difficult for people to move here, we are waiting until at least January 2021 to bring an initial batch of Martians to start an academic quarter. 

    However, a small number of us are already living here, and we are open for those enthusiastic about our program to join us this fall, on a case-by-case basis. During this time, we are smaller and more informal, and mostly focused on infrastructure projects and building out Mars in preparation for our first batch. We are especially looking for people who would be able to help us build. If you are interested in participating during this exciting and formative time, please <a href="/join/#form">get in touch with us</a>.


    <h2>How we are dealing with COVID-19</h2>

    In keeping consistent with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC guidelines</a>, we are exploring a range of possible strategies for keeping our community safe from COVID. We'll keep a close eye on the pandemic as it evolves, and our strategies will attempt to meet the current risk level. 

    While the risk level remains high, we will attempt to make our community a "<a href="https://www.endcoronavirus.org/green-zones">green zone</a>," by limiting close physical contact with the outside world (easy, since we're already fairly isolated and self-sufficient) and implementing a mandatory quarantine on entry for all people joining, including ourselves. The quarantine will be a period of 7-14 days during which you are given a tent and your own utencils, and you must wear a mask and maintain a distance from everybody else, as well as staying out of designated indoor spaces. At the end of that period, you take a test, and if you test negative, you get to take off the mask and join our community with all restrictions lifted. If you test positive, the quarantine will continue until a re-test is negative, and we will take care of you and help you get medical assistance if necessary.

    We hope that over time, as the pandemic wanes or a vaccine becomes available, we can suspend the quarantine program.
