    <h3>
    Academic life on Mars revolves around study groups that are formed around subjects of interest. Study groups are the first and only level of organization at Mars College, are initiated by members, and can vary in number of members from 2 to everyone. They may receive dedicated space and/or infrastructure to pursue their resarch, and are encouraged to leverage online courses, blogs, open-source code/instructables, and other online resources on our high-speed internet.  Study groups are expected to periodically organize presentations, workshops, exhibitions, or other kinds of events for the rest of members, showing off the fruits of their study.
    </h3>
    <h3>
    Study groups come in many forms, from those studying art and technology (e.g. deep learning, VR/XR, telepresence) to those researching quality of life skills (e.g. vanlife, fitness, work-remote). Study groups that have commercial applications can potentially earn their members a revenue stream or spin off separate ventures or enterprises.
